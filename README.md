# Banking Data Warehouse & Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project builds a data warehouse and dashboard to analyse customer banking data. It uses **dbt** for data transformation and **Metabase** for visualisation.

The dataset includes customer attributes like **credit scores, balances, estimated salaries, satisfaction scores, and card types**. 

The goal is to **derive key business insights** and precompute summary metrics for performance optimisation.

## Project Structure
The project follows a structured approach with dbt models, tests and macros:

## Key Features

### âœ… Conceptual, Logical and Physical Data Modelling
![alt text](image.png)

The data has been kept denormalised in a single table. This was a conscious design decision justified below:

- **Optimised for Analytical Queries** The dataset is intended for a read-heavy workload in a Data Warehouse (DWH). Keeping all relevant customer information in one table reduces the need for costly joins, improving query performance.

- **Logical Cohesion** The raw data is tightly coupled to individual customers. Splitting it into multiple tables would introduce unnecessary complexity without a clear business benefit.

- **Precomputed Summary Tables** Instead of normalisation, performance optimisations have been applied at the summary table level in dbt to ensure quick retrieval of key insights.

- **Simplifies Dashboard Implementation** Since Metabase is used to visualise data, a flat structure ensures that queries are simpler, making dashboard development more efficient.


### âœ… Data Transformation with dbt
- **Source Data:** Stored in `raw_banking` table
- **Fact Table:** `customers.sql` contains all customer attributes
- **Summary Tables:** Precomputed insights for dashboard queries
- **Data Quality Tests:** Used dbt's built-in tests (checking for unique values, nulls and accepted values from predefined lists) and built custom `is_numeric` and `is_alphabetical` tests ensure data integrity

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard Implementation (Metabase)
- **Visualises summary tables** for performance
- Includes key business metrics:
  - Total money in the bank
  - Most popular card type
  - Estimated salaries of customers
  - Credit score, balance, satisfaction by geography
  - Card types for wealthiest customers
- Uses a combination of **bar charts, pie charts, and tables**

### ðŸš€ Performance Considerations
- Data remains **denormalised** since it is a read-heavy workload
- Summary tables (instead of views) are used for precomputed metrics, ensuring faster queries in the dashboard.git 
- Raw data is tightly coupled with customers, making **denormalisation logical**
